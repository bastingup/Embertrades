# Embertrades
Embertrades is a fullstack crypto trading bot, consisting of a React Frontend, which is in very early development, and a NodeJS backend.
The software launches a React Webapp on one port and the NodeJS server on another port. Conneted via an API, Embertrade will offer an easy-to-use dashboard with a clean and organized overview of all relevant trading signals.
The Embertrades backend, written as NodeJS is capable of utilizing a variety of technical indicators with variable settings, like the ADX, MACD, MA and many others, in order to give a comprehensive market overview. The indicators check and cross validate market trends, buy/sell signals, as well as direction of movement.
The software is connected to Binance via its API. Front- and backend communicate via API.

All index files are for development purposes, the main files are the actual core files.
The project is still under early development. Todos are seperating the main into respective classes, getting rid of the huge amount of global variables and connecting it to the frontend for proper usage.
